AstroToolBox is a Java tool set for the identification and classification of astronomical objects with a focus on very low-mass and ultra-cool dwarfs. It contains a catalog search for SIMBAD (measurements & references), AllWISE, CatWISE, unWISE, Gaia DR2, Gaia eDR3, NOIRLab Source Catalog (NSC) DR2, Pan-STARRS DR2, SDSS DR16, VHS DR5, 2MASS and TESS (TIC-8) catalogs and a spectral type evaluation feature for main sequence stars including brown dwarfs. The spectral type evaluation feature uses the relation described in Pecaut & Mamajek (2013), Best et al. (2018), Carnero Rosell et al. (2019), Skrzypek et al. (2015), Skrzypek et al. (2016) and Kiman et al. (2019). The tool plots spectral energy distributions, using Pan-STARRS/NSC DR2, 2MASS/VHS and AllWISE photometry, and automatically compares them to model SEDs. There is also a feature that enables the drawing of Gaia color-magnitude diagrams. Furthermore, the tool has an image viewer that can blink images of different epochs, using WISE coadds (Meisner et al. 2017) epochs 2010 to 2020 and DECaLS cutouts (Dey et al. 2019) DR5 to DR9, in order to visually identify motion or variability of objects. These images can be saved as PNG or animated GIF files. Overlays of all featured catalogs can be added if necessary. Custom overlays can be created from VizieR catalogs or local files. The tool can display time series (static or animated) using infrared and optical images of various surveys (DSS, SDSS, 2MASS, AllWISE, DECaLS). It contains a photometric classifier that uses the photometry of the above mentioned catalogs to create a detailed spectral type classification. The tool also includes an ADQL query interface (IRSA, VizieR, NOAO) and a batch spectral type lookup feature that uses a CSV file with object coordinates as input. In addition, the tool has a file browser linked to the image viewer, which makes it possible to check a large list of objects in a convenient way. Interesting finds can be saved in an object collection for later use. The tool also offers a number of handy astrometric calculators and converters.
