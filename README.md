AstroToolBox is a Java program designed for the citizen scientists project "Backyard Worlds: Planet 9" hosted at the Zooniverse platform. It's a tool set that contains a catalog search tool (SIMBAD, Gaia DR2, AllWISE and CatWISE), a spectral type lookup feature (main sequence, M-L-T-Y and white dwarfs), a WiseView-style image viewer, an ADQl query interface (all catalogs hosted at IRSA), a batch query runner (import your csv files for spectral type evaluation), a file browser (view and edit your csv files and those exported from the tool) and a bunch of handy calculators and converters.
